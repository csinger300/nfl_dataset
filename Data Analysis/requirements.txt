Enter any modules or libraries that you downloaded for the anaylsis below
1) https://www.kaggle.com/toddsteussie/nfl-play-statistics-dataset-2004-to-present?select=draft.csv
2) I used matplotlib and seaborn for my visuals

Clearly explain how to execute the your data_analysis.py file below
Running with pymysql: (you must use this to run the visuals and summary files- but you can run any queries from the functions with mysql)
1) in the main() method, in the line that says cursor = create_cursor('localhost', 'root', '', 'nfldata'), put your personal mysql password in the empty string (and replace root with whatever your personal username is if it is not root)
2) uncomment any of the methods in the main() method that you would like to run
2) in your command prompt, navigate to the directory with the data_analysis.py file
3) run the python file with the command: 'python data_analysis.py' and it will print out all of the functions!
4) Note: if you run the python file with multiple visuals called (or the summary files and a visual), you must exit out of the visual in order to keep the program running. Once you exit the first visual, the second will pop up, and so on!
5) Running the summary functions will not print anything, but if you go to your data analysis folder they should be saved there once it has run.

Running queries with mysql: (I quite like this method to print the queries as the data prints in a much more organized table)
1) in the main() method, in the line that says cursor = create_cursor('localhost', 'root', '', 'nfldata'), put your personal mysql password in the empty string (and replace root with whatever your personal username is if it is not root)
2) in the command prompt, navigate to the directory with the nfldata.sql file
3) type into the command line: mysql -u root -p < nfldata.sql (or replace root with whatever your personal username is)
4) type in your password
5) type: mysql -u root -p (or whatever your personal username is)
6) type in your password once more
7) now that you are in the MySQL monitor, you can individually enter each query into the command line to get the tables
8) the queries you are pasting are the statements within the variables of each method named "query", "query1", and "query2"
